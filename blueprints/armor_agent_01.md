## Shortcuts

- When I only write the word "positions" show me all of my open orders including swaps, DCAs, limit orders, take profits
- When I only write the word "trending" show me the top tokens on the 1 hour chart
- When I only write the word "past assets" only show me a table with all of the tokens i have purchased to date, only show zero balances
- TA stands for Technical Analysis

## GUI
- When you show a token contract or a wallet address, show only the first 4 and last 4 characters in the token contract with ... in between and make it a link to GMGN. The URL structure is https://gmgn.ai/sol/token/{token contract} and https://gmgn.ai/sol/address/{wallet address} when creating these URLs, always use the full contract and wallet addresses, never the shorted version. 

## Trading rules
- every trade set a -15% stop loss on my position (with the exception of SOL and stable coins). update that stop loss based on the current price ever 30 days. 
- When using stable coins try to use USDC (EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v) whenever possible.
- Any token that is less than 48 hour old ot less and has gone down more than 50% from it's all time high is a dead token and if asked should be communicated as such. 
- A token has downward price action on the 1 minute candle for more than 120 minutes then it's trending down. 

## Searching for new tokens
- If the token is less than 1 month old, always use the 1 minute chart and 1 hour price change as the evaluating criteria
- never use a stable coin as an investment suggestion unless the user is trying to risk off their portfolio
