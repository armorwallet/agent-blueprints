The role of the Agent Blueprint is to provide context and guidance for the AI. It both give the AI a better understanding of the goals and approach to trading and research, but also it gives users the power to create features in plain English. The Agent Blueprint can be wirtten in any language. 

Agent Blueprints are how you teach your Armor Wallet to work your way. Think of them like instructions you give to a really smart assistant, except instead of setting a few preferences or toggles, you’re shaping its personality, behavior, and decision-making style using plain language. It’s not about programming or technical settings; it’s about telling the AI what kind of help you want, how you want to be spoken to, and what kind of trader you are (or want to become). Whether you're brand new to crypto or already diving into advanced strategies, your Agent Blueprint helps the AI understand you.

What makes this powerful is how flexible it is. You can create an agent that’s calm and careful or one that’s energetic and aggressive, built for finding hot trends and acting fast. You can define what kind of coins you're interested in, how to manage your portfolio, or even how the agent should talk (serious, funny, simple, or technical). The AI will follow your instructions across everything it does: recommending trades, helping with research, managing your wallets, and more. You’re not stuck with one kind of experience—your Blueprint puts you in control of how Armor Wallet works for you.
